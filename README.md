# ByeByeBuddy
This is the code from my Final year project called ByeByeBuddy. Acting as an extension of matterports Mask R-cnn. I use Mask R-cnn to detect features in images and then interface with Photoshop to delete selected features and fill in the background to seem as if they were never there.
